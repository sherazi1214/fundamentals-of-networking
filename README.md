### What is Networking? (Definition)
Networking is the process of connecting two or more computers or devices together to share resources, exchange data, and communicate. It involves a system of hardware and software that allows devices to communicate over wired or wireless connections, either locally (LAN) or globally (like the internet).

## Explanation of Networking
In the digital world, nothing operates in isolation. Devices — such as computers, smartphones, printers, and servers — need to communicate with each other to perform useful tasks.
